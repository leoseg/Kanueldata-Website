# Kanueldata-Website
Spring-Boot Webcontainer for displaying feauture data extracted from the Bioimpedance-, Breathing- and EMG-Signals measured at the neck while swallowing with electrodes.
Data are displayed summarized (so one datapoint for one feature) or with all features, so one datapoint is for one swallow.


## Purpose
Mainly for practicing Spring Boot and Java. Originated from one of my Projekts at the TU-Berlin. 
Project can be run in a dockerfile local. Postgress authentication is needed.
